Develop in Pharo, then deploy to GemStone.

## Intro

GemStone is a great Object Database and Smalltalk sys. Pharo is my favorite Smalltalk develop environment.

Unfortunately, the develop toolchain for gemstone is weird and out dated. I cannot install GemTool. I must using Jade on Windows, and connect to a Unix/Mac server.

I want to use Pharo, so I write this simple tool.

Develop in Pharo, and then use this tool to translate to a topaz script. Then input it from topaz shell.
